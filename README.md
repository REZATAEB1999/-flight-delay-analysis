Flight Delay Analysis
This is my first real-world data project using:
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas
I analyzed flight passenger data (airtravel.csv) and created a simple bar chart.
The notebook file is flight_delay_analysis.ipynb.
Iâ€™m learning how to work with data and share my projects on GitHub.
